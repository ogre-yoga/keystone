# Lesson 2: Creating relationships

Learn how to connect two content types to each another and configure how you make those connections in Admin UI.

## Where we left off

In the [first lesson](/docs/walkthroughs/lesson-1) we got our Keystone blog project up and running with a database and `user` list:

```js
// keystone.ts
import { list, config } from '@keystone-6/core';
import { text } from '@keystone-6/core/fields';

export default config({
  db: {
    provider: 'sqlite',
    url: 'file:./keystone.db',
  },
  lists: {
    User: list({
      fields: {
        name: text({ isRequired: true }),
        email: text({ isRequired: true }),
      },
    }),
  },
});
```

We’re now going to help those users make `posts` with a title, some publishing fields, and the 'content'.

## Make a Lists object

Before we define fields for a `post` type, let's pull lists out into its own object so it's easier to reason about going forward:

```js{5-12,19}
// keystone.ts
import { list, config } from '@keystone-6/core';
import { text } from '@keystone-6/core/fields';

const lists = {
  User: list({
    fields: {
      name: text({ isRequired: true }),
      email: text({ isRequired: true }),
    },
  }),
};

export default config({
  db: {
    provider: 'sqlite',
    url: 'file:./keystone.db',
  },
  lists,
});
```

!> Protip: you could also move lists into its own file, and import it into `keystone.ts`

## Create a Post list

To create a post type we add a second `Post` key to the lists object. Let’s add `text` field types for the post’s `title` and `content`:

```js{11-16}[2-4,19-26]
//keystone.js
import { list, config } from '@keystone-6/core';
import { text } from '@keystone-6/core/fields';

const lists = {
  User: list({
    fields: {
      name: text({ isRequired: true }),
      email: text({ isRequired: true }),
    },
  }),
  Post: list({
    fields: {
      title: text(),
      content: text(),
      // content field later on
    },
  }),
};

export default config({
  db: {
    provider: 'sqlite',
    url: 'file:./keystone.db',
  },
  lists,
});
```

Let's check that this works. Boot up our keystone app and have a look:

## Connecting users with posts

The important thing we need to model next with our list is a relationship between a user and posts. For deciding on how they relate we should ask:

"Does a user have many posts?"
"Does a post have many authors?"

For this case, we are saying a post only has one author, but a user has many posts.

To define this relationship, we will add a field to each list that defines how they relate to each other:

```js{8,15}[6-7,13-14]
import { text, relationship } from '@keystone-6/core/fields';

const lists = {
  User: list({
    fields: {
      name: text({ isRequired: true }),
      email: text({ isRequired: true }),
      posts: relationship({ ref: 'Post.author', many: true }),
    },
  }),
  Post: list({
    fields: {
      title: text(),
      content: text(),
      author: relationship({ ref: 'User.posts' }),
    },
  }),
};
```

The relationship references the name for the `field` of the list it is relating to to make it a two-way connection, so the
`author` field relates to `User.posts`, while the `posts` field relates to `User.author`. Naming these relationships can be
important if lists have multiple relationships. If, for example, we wanted to let users also 'like' posts, we could add a
second differently named relationship between `User` and `Post`

## Looking at the admin UI

Quickly, let's open the Admin UI and create a post.

This experience is a bit rough. The `text()` field for the post's content is a very bad editing experience. Additionally, while the authors's
name is shown in the post, we want to make editing the author from a post easier.
Thankfully, keystone allows you to define how the admin UI presents this information.

## Improving the Admin UI Experience

The main way to tweak the admin UI for this is in the `ui` options for a `field`. All field types have a `ui` option that you can explore, but
for this we want to focus on a few simple improvements.

### Using a text area for the content

In a field, there are `ui` options that can be provided. Here, we can change the `displayMode` for text to be `textarea`.

```js{14}[4-10]
import { text, relationship } from '@keystone-6/core/fields';

const lists = {
  User: list({
    fields: {
      name: text({ isRequired: true }),
      email: text({ isRequired: true }),
      posts: relationship({ ref: 'Post.author', many: true }),
    },
  }),
  Post: list({
    fields: {
      title: text(),
      content: text({ ui: { displayMode: 'textarea'}}),
      author: relationship({ ref: 'User.posts' }),
    },
  }),
};
```

### Improving the display of the User relationship in Posts

The next thing to do is improve the inline experience for authors in posts.

```js{17-23}[4-10]
import { text, relationship } from '@keystone-6/core/fields';

const lists = {
  User: list({
    fields: {
      name: text({ isRequired: true }),
      email: text({ isRequired: true }),
      posts: relationship({ ref: 'Post.author', many: true }),
    },
  }),
  Post: list({
    fields: {
      title: text(),
      content: text({ ui: { displayMode: 'textarea'}}),
      author: relationship({
        ref: 'User.posts',
        ui: {
          displayMode: 'cards',
          cardFields: ['name', 'email'],
          inlineEdit: { fields: ['name', 'email'] },
          linkToItem: true,
          inlineCreate: { fields: ['name', 'email'] },
        },
      }),
    },
  }),
};
```

We've made a few changes here, so let's break them down. The first is the relationship is shown as a `card` isntead of just a name,
and we've made sure that the card links to the user item.

The second is we have made the user attributes of name and email editable inline.

## What We Have Now

At the end of this lesson, our app has a new `post` list, which has info for its title and content, as well as a link to the author, and a time stamp for when it will be published. It config file looks like:

```js
import { list, config } from '@keystone-6/core';
import { text, timestamp, relationship } from '@keystone-6/core/fields';

const lists = {
  User: list({
    fields: {
      name: text({ isRequired: true }),
      email: text({ isRequired: true }),
      posts: relationship({ ref: 'Post.author', many: true }),
    },
  }),
  Post: list({
    fields: {
      title: text(),
      content: text({ ui: { displayMode: 'textarea'}}),
      author: relationship({
        ref: 'User.posts',
        ui: {
          displayMode: 'cards',
          cardFields: ['name', 'email'],
          inlineEdit: { fields: ['name', 'email'] },
          linkToItem: true,
          inlineCreate: { fields: ['name', 'email'] },
        },
      }),
    },
  }),
};

export default config({
  db: {
    provider: 'sqlite',
    url: 'file:./keystone.db',
  },
  lists,
});
```
